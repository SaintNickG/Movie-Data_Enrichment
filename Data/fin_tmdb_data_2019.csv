At first, the girl and the babysitter have little in common. The girl, Sarah, is focused on school, colleges, jobs, and the financial markets. The babysitter, Nellie, is a carefree, happy person who worked in a restaurant before getting hired by Sarah’s father, Steve, to spend time with Sarah over summer vacation. Over time, Nellie teaches Sarah several important lessons about life, and finally prods Sarah into talking about what happened to her mother. Sarah has only fleeting memories about her mother, and is afraid to ask her father about the truth. It turns out, Sarah is also afraid of insects. Nellie teaches Sarah to overcome her fears, to find strength, and how to find balance that is missing in her life. We find out that Nellie had a life experience years ago that gave her strength to work through life struggles and achieve something amazing in her own right.",0.6000000000000001,/b6c3dag65JpfS0KHlwQUifbCafN.jpg,[],"[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",2019-12-12,0.0,86.0,[],Released,,Rounded Corners,0.0,0.0,0.0,

It unfolds over a single day and follows an 11-year-old boy’s relentless quest to profess his love to a girl in his class. As the invasion encroaches on Beirut, it upends the day, threatening the entire country and its cohesion. Within the microcosm of the school, the film draws a harrowing portrait of a society torn between its desire for love and peace and the ideological schisms unraveling its seams.  In his debut feature, director Oualid Mouaness delivers an ode to innocence in which he revisits one of the most cataclysmic moments in Lebanon's history through the lens of a child and his vibrant imagination.
