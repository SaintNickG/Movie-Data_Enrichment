The origin of this enigmatic book troubles him. This particular science-fiction novel would have materialized during a spiritual session in modern day Rome. At the session, an old woman revealed that the key to all these mysteries comes from 1895, a time during which the Lumière Brothers had denied lending their camera to Georges Méliès for an obscure movie called ""A Trip to the moon"".

Brillante Mendoza grapples with the issue of loss of national identity and home, with a story set in the Obihiro area of Hokkaido and Manila in the Philippines. Isao Yukisada directs a story in Malaysia where the Japanese army was once stationed but is now home to many Japanese retirees living out their remaining years. An elderly man has parted from his family in Japan to live alone in Penang, but when a new helper comes to the house, he slowly opens his mind and an unexpected bond forms between the two. Finally director Sotho Kulikar conveys a beautiful but heart-rending love story between a Japanese man and Cambodian woman that unfolds across past and present against the backdrop of Cambodia's civil war.",1.4,/7OSvxUWaHFNgmYPHPcRo0JHmJIL.jpg,[],"[{'iso_3166_1': 'JP', 'name': 'Japan'}]",2016-08-26,0.0,118.0,"[{'english_name': 'English', 'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}, {'english_name': 'Japanese', 'iso_639_1': 'ja', 'name': '日本語'}, {'english_name': 'Khmer', 'iso_639_1': 'km', 'name': ''}, {'english_name': 'Malay', 'iso_639_1': 'ms', 'name': 'Bahasa melayu'}, {'english_name': 'Tagalog', 'iso_639_1': 'tl', 'name': ''}]",Released,Living Together in Asia,Asian Three-Fold Mirror 2016: Reflections,0.0,0.0,0.0,

Even more painful is that the love of his life, one of his ex-students, reveals herself to be a gifted artist. To some she’s even considered to be the true successor to Benavidez’s father. It’s no wonder that this creates tensions and after a devastating lovers quarrel, Benavidez puts all his artworks into a big case and, having nowhere else to go, drags it to his shrink. The man specializes in treating creative spirits and even has an artist’s colony in the basement of his huge mansion. As part of their therapy, his patients produce artworks that get sold for lucrative prizes at auctions organized by the psychiatrist himself.

This is Charlie's idea of fun, Evan's idea of a nightmare, and Markie's idea of-well he's young and idealistic; he's just going with the flow. .",2.446,/nixNufqDyKwr8E38ED28mkC1Cwd.jpg,"[{'id': 142151, 'logo_path': '/Aq6Bc70IcVtNIvZTN0Hc7MPfRFB.png', 'name': 'Imagicomm Entertainment', 'origin_country': 'US'}, {'id': 142153, 'logo_path': '/uobNAWGo2zAbV5ZZB2vXGufdaby.png', 'name': 'INSP Films', 'origin_country': 'US'}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",2016-09-02,0.0,92.0,"[{'english_name': 'English', 'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,,Heritage Falls,0.0,6.4,5.0,PG
